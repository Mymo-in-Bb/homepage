Hi! Welcome to my homepage! My name is Rosie (she/her), and I make stuff sometimes. I study computer science and game development, but aside from that, my hobbies also include making music, worldbuilding, conlanging and creative writing. Here, you'll be able to find the aggregate of my work that I consider personally significant, or that I need to share with the public.

You can also find me on [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/bbmymo), where I just reblog whatever (though I do have some more specialised sideblogs), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mymo_in_Bb), where I post my music and trailers for games I make with friends, and on [itch.io](https://mymo-in-bb.itch.io/), where you can play said games.
