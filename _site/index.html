I study computer science and game development, but aside from that, my hobbies also include making music, worldbuilding, conlanging and creative writing. Here, you’ll be able to find the aggregate of my work that I consider personally significant, or that I need to share with the public.</p>

<p>You can also find me on <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/bbmymo">Tumblr</a>, where I just reblog whatever (though I do have some more specialised sideblogs), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mymo_in_Bb">YouTube</a>, where I post my music and trailers for games I make with friends, and on <a href="https://mymo-in-bb.itch.io/">itch.io</a>, where you can play said games.</p>

<h1 id="conlanging">Conlanging</h1>

<p><em>Main site: <a href="/conlangs.html">Conlangs</a></em></p>

<p>I am in the process of creating two languages for my worldbuilding project, both of which have their own public reference grammars and can be found on Tumblr.</p>

<h2 id="kolic">Kolic</h2>

<p>Kolic is a language that started out as heavily influenced in vibes by Icelandic, and then slowly shifted to be more vaguely Indo-European-influenced, eventually moving beyond even that with levels of agglutination unseen in Indo-European languages as far as I’m aware (though it still pales in comparison to languages like Kalaallisut). Its phonology is still very obviously influenced by Icelandic, and one of its distinguishing features is the lack of adpositions, whose function is carried entirely with dozens of cases, some of which can even be combined together (similarly in principle to the Finnish locatives, though somewhat more regular).</p>

<p>Kolic is still very much in development — some of its grammar isn’t defined yet, and it’s only got a couple hundred words so far.</p>

<h2 id="viil">Viil</h2>

<p>Just like Kolic started with mainly Icelandic inspiration, The original idea behind Viil was “A language that’s kinda like Inuktitut” (the name “Viil” even originally comes from the acronym “Vaguely Inuktitut-Inspired Language”, though now it also gained a new canonical in-universe meaning). Viil is a polysynthetic, strongly head-marking language, where each root can mean many different related things (spanning different parts of speech) based on which affixes are attached to it. One of its interesting features is the complete lack of a copula (word for “to be”), instead relying on turning nouns and adjectives into verbs themselves.</p>

<p>Viil is in the early stages of development, with most of its grammar still undefined, and only a couple words.</p>

<h1 id="games">Games</h1>

<p><em>Main site: <a href="/games.html">Games</a></em></p>

<p>I’ve made a couple small games, either solo or as a part of a small team with friends on game jams (which is the case for most of them). Here’s a chronological list of the games I consider important enough to put here:</p>

<h2 id="the-new-life-of-eilidh-mhorganach-aka-unselbane">The New Life of Eilidh Mhorganach (a.k.a. Unselbane)</h2>

<p>This unweildy name belongs to my first ever game jam submission, which I made for the 15th Pirate Software Game Jam. It’s made primarily with accessibility for blind players in mind, being playable (and in fact, best enjoyed) without any visuals.</p>

<p>I made the game with my friend Kris, who helped me with voice acting, proof-reading, playtesting and consulted the gameplay with me.</p>

<p>The New Life of Eilidh Mhorganach is a rhythm game about a blind alchemist who returns to her lab for the first time after her accident, and learns how to brew potions by ear with the help of her wife Leagsaidh and her lab assistant Calum.</p>

<p>The game unfortunately has a way too steep learning curve, especially if you’re not a skilled musician familiar with the layout of a piano keyboard.</p>

<p>It can be played in the browser and requires only a (computer) keyboard. MIDI keyboards are unfortunately not supported, even though that would be really fun. Maybe if I make a new version in the future, I’ll be able to add that.</p>

<p>Although our game didn’t get to the top 10 winners, we were, as far as I know, among the ~ 57 games (out of 2370) that got a perfect score by the judges.</p>

<h2 id="rotator">Rotator</h2>

<p>We made Rotator with my friends Ondra and Kris for the GDS Prague Game Jam at Matfyz at the end of 2024. This was my first ever in-person game jam, as well as my first 48-hour one. Rotator is “A fantastical platformer set in a whimsical world debating the nature of change and how we perceive it,” as Kris eloquently wrote in the game’s description on itch.io.</p>

<p>I made the music for this one, as well as some of the programming, though that was definitely more carried by Ondra.</p>

<p>We didn’t manage to place or get an honourable mention, and the game does have its rough edges, but I really love what we crafted and it’s to this day one of my favourite projects I’ve worked on. The vibe of this game is really something.</p>

<p>It can be played on the web, or downloaded for Linux or Windows. You can play with a keyboard or a controller. Just beware, there’s one jump toward the end that’s <em>really</em> difficult to get (we dubbed it the Calum jump becuase of how everyone hates it).</p>

<h2 id="cest-bien-lex">C’est Bien, Lex</h2>

<p>This game was a submission to the 2025 FlyingJam at Matfyz, that we made with my friends Tonda, who pragrammed with me, Nori, who made all the graphics, and Dan, who made all the music. Unlike the grim atmosphere of Rotator, this game is a sweet short story about two unlikely lesbian lovers — a Queen and a thief — told through the letters they send each other in secret. You play as a postal owl delivering these letters, and the gameplay switches between enveloping them, where you can get a peek at their relationship, and flying between them, dodging obstacles.</p>

<p>This game actually made it into the honourable mentions, and was well perceived by the judges.</p>

<p>It can be played in the browser, using the keyboard and mouse, or a controller (or controller and mouse - we found that it’s most comfortable to use a mouse for packing the letters, and a controller for flying - but you don’t <em>need</em> both.)</p>

<h2 id="next-target-mothership">Next Target: Mothership</h2>

<p>This is a game I made in Unity 😵‍💫 for a uni course. I personally prefer Godot, but Unity was required by the course (for which I’m actually really glad, because I’m pretty sure I will be required to work with it in the future and this way, I’m more or less prepared for the mess that Unity is). I made this game completely solo, and it continues with my interest in making accessible games, and specifically accessible to blind players.</p>

<p>In Next Target: Mothership, you play as the blind researcher Eris who was accidentally left behind on a vacant space station and needs to escape on her own. The game is about navigating in 3D space with 6 degrees of freedom, all using sound — though there are several layers of accessibility features that provide visual guidance, to the point of being playable even without any sound whatsoever (though as I recently found out, these might be somewhat bugged in the current export? I’ll have to look into that).</p>

<p>Although the game focuses on accessibility, I unfortunately didn’t get to impement key rebinding or controller support before the deadline.</p>
