I am in the process of creating two languages for my worldbuilding project, both of which have their own public reference grammars and can be found on Tumblr.

## Kolic {#kolic}

Kolic is a language that started out as heavily influenced in vibes by Icelandic, and then slowly shifted to be more vaguely Indo-European-influenced, eventually moving beyond even that with levels of agglutination unseen in Indo-European languages as far as I'm aware (though it still pales in comparison to languages like Kalaallisut). Its phonology is still very obviously influenced by Icelandic, and one of its distinguishing features is the lack of adpositions, whose function is carried entirely with dozens of cases, some of which can even be combined together (similarly in principle to the Finnish locatives, though somewhat more regular). 

Kolic is still very much in development --- some of its grammar isn't defined yet, and it's only got a couple hundred words so far.

## Viil {#viil}

Just like Kolic started with mainly Icelandic inspiration, The original idea behind Viil was "A language that's kinda like Inuktitut" (the name "Viil" even originally comes from the acronym "Vaguely Inuktitut-Inspired Language", though now it also gained a new canonical in-universe meaning). Viil is a polysynthetic, strongly head-marking language, where each root can mean many different related things (spanning different parts of speech) based on which affixes are attached to it. One of its interesting features is the complete lack of a copula (word for "to be"), instead relying on turning nouns and adjectives into verbs themselves.

Viil is in the early stages of development, with most of its grammar still undefined, and only a couple words.
